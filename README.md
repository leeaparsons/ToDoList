The goal of this project was to write a command-line program, in Java, to act as a to-do list/task organisation tool, to allow users to organise tasks into to-do lists.

List of features:
1. The ability to list all to do lists’ names in the system – there should be at least two 
in the program when it is first run.
2. The ability to view an individual to do list.
3. The ability to append to (add items to the end of) an existing to do list.
4. The ability to remove individual items from a to do list (this can be anywhere 
within the list).
5. The ability to create new to do lists (with a name and a list of tasks that the user 
may enter).
6. The ability to record completion of individual tasks within a to do list.
